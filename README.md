# Code & Cookies

Code & Cookies is an informal, pseudo-anarchistic, self-organizing assembly of (mostly web)
developers in the greater Enschede area.

Membership is open to anyone who cares to show up at the spontaneous and sporadically organized
gatherings.

Any member can call a meeting, hackathon or meetup whenever they feel like it.
Due to the autonomous nature of the group, attendance is not guaranteed.

There are only two rule:

1. It should be fun
2. It shouldn't be work

Memebers are free to ignore either or both of these rules.
